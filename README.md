### 🦙 Project Plan: A Petting Zoo Visit  

Welcome to **Project Plan: A Petting Zoo Visit**! 🐾 This C# console application was developed as part of the **C# Foundational Certification by Microsoft** and is one of the **Challenger Projects** designed to test core C# skills.  

This project helps organize school visits to a petting zoo by **randomizing animals** and **assigning them to groups**, ensuring that each school group experiences a well-structured and engaging visit with different animals.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ Randomizes animal assignments per visit  
✅ Organizes visiting schools into groups  
✅ Displays group allocation dynamically  
✅ Supports both default and custom group sizes  

---

## 🏫 How It Works  
The program currently supports three schools:  
- **School A** (default 6 groups)  
- **School B** (3 groups)  
- **School C** (2 groups)  

Each school visit follows these steps:  
1️⃣ Randomly shuffle the list of animals 🦘🐑🐓  
2️⃣ Distribute the animals evenly among groups  
3️⃣ Print the assigned groups per school
